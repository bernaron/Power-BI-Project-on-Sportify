The Spotify Global Sales Power BI Project is designed to provide an in-depth analysis of Spotify's global sales performance and user engagement patterns. With the rapid growth of music streaming services, understanding data-driven insights is critical for maintaining a competitive edge in a dynamic market. This project utilizes Power BI to visualize key metrics such as sales trends, user behavior, market segmentation, and regional performance.

By leveraging a combination of sales data and user engagement statistics, this project aims to empower decision-makers with actionable insights for enhancing revenue streams and audience satisfaction.

##Project Brief
The project focuses on addressing the following key business questions:

How are Spotify's sales performing globally over time?
Which regions and genres contribute the most to overall sales?
What trends in user engagement can be identified across different regions?
What are the key opportunities to drive further growth in underperforming markets?
To answer these questions, the project involved data cleaning, transformation, and visualization using Power BI. KPIs such as total sales, active users, average revenue per user (ARPU), and regional market share were prioritized to present a clear picture of Spotify's performance.
